        <p>I created this website for my SI 539 class at the School of Information at the University of Michigan. SI 539 is titled "Web Design: Responsiveness and Accessibility." It is taught by Dr. Colleen Van Lent and my GSI is Nida Hameed. We go over really important information in the field of User Experience such as accessibility and creating websites that follow accessibility guidelines. I took this class my first semester of completing my Master of Science degree in Information. A co-requisite for this course is SI 506. SI 506 is a class about coding in Python. </p>
        <p>If you have any questions about anything on this site, or want to know more about the classes I'm taking - feel free to use the contact form on the "Contact" tab. I would be happy to talk more about my experiences at the University of Michigan as well! </p>
